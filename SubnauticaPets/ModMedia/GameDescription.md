# Subnautica Pets 2

> The Alterra Corporation may be known for their monopoly of the weapons trade during The Expansion, but what they desire more than profit is control. Control of the weapons markets, control of their devoted employees, control of the very environments in which they operate.
>
> Ever on the lookout for opportunity, Alterra executives devised a secret mission: the scientific crew of the Aurora were to tame and weaponize the native creatures of 4546B. These innocent beasts were to be transformed into formidable weapons, ready to march into battle as foot soldiers of the highest bidder.
>
> However, fate had different plans. The Aurora met a tragic demise, thwarting the realization of this ambitious goal. In the explosive aftermath, strewn across the wreckage of the stricken vessel, cloning equipment lies broken, the mission unfufilled.
>
> Ever enterprising, you see not waste but untapped potential. While these creatures may be useless as weapons to you, they hold the promise of companionship and hope in troubled times.

### User Guide

With this new Subnautica Pets mod, I've rebuilt from the ground up with the intention of introducing "lore-friendly" gameplay around the “Pets” concept. With this in mind, this mod is ideally played "as is", with discovery playing a part in getting the most out of the mod.

Unlike previous versions, there are no “mod options” or keyboard shortcuts. All mod functionality is built into the game.

### Help and Feedback

If you have trouble with the mod, or have questions, thoughts or feedback regarding gameplay, please get in touch!
