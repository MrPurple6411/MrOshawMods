# Subnautica Pets 2

## Introduction

> The Alterra Corporation may be known for their monopoly of the weapons trade during The Expansion, but what they desire more than profit is control. Control of the weapons markets, control of their devoted employees, control of the very environments in which they operate.
>
> Ever on the lookout for opportunity, Alterra executives devised a secret mission: the scientific crew of the Aurora were to tame and weaponize the native creatures of 4546B. These innocent beasts were to be transformed into formidable weapons, ready to march into battle as foot soldiers of the highest bidder.
>
> However, fate had different plans. The Aurora met a tragic demise, thwarting the realization of this ambitious goal. In the explosive aftermath, strewn across the wreckage of the stricken vessel, cloning equipment lies broken, the mission unfufilled.
>
> Ever enterprising, you see not waste but untapped potential. While these creatures may be useless as weapons to you, they hold the promise of companionship and hope in troubled times.

## Spoilers

This new version of the Pets mod has been created in a way to make the experience more "organic", with discovery and task / reward focussed gameplay, rather than "instant access" to pets. If you want to get straight to spawning Pets, this section will point you in the right direction, at the expense of discovering things for yourself. Only read on if you are happy with this!

Spawning pets requires three things:

1. **A Pet Fabricator** - this is a new base "internal module" that can be built using the habitat builder. It works like existing fabricators, using materials to "spawn" new pets. To unlock the blueprint, you must first scan 3 fragments. These fragments are scattered across the map, typically within existing debris site locations. If you need specific coordinates, these are listed below.
2. **A Pet Console** - this is another new "internal module", used to "manage" pets. It provides functions to rename and "kill" spawned pets. It also requires 3 scanned fragments.
3. **Pet DNA** - this is a "collectable resource", spawned across the map within existing debris sites. There are specific DNA types for each pet, and sufficient DNA must be collected in order to fabricate new pets. Wherever you find pet module fragments, you'll find plenty of DNA samples.

You can use the "bobthebuilder" console cheat code to unlock the interior modules and provide infinite resources, including Pet DNA, if you want to skip all discovery elements of the mod.
