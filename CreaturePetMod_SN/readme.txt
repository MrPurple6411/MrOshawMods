SUBNAUTICA PETS BZ - 1.0.0
Adorable pets to welcome you home!

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
* A responsible adult, willing to look after and tend to their pets

:: FEATURES ::
* Choose from one of three snugglesome pets! Adorable!
* Spawn in any indoor location, above ground or underwater! Shooo shhwweeet!
* Choose from a selection of names to personalise each pet! Coochy coochy coo!
* Watch the little critters scurry around your base, walking, jumping and sleeping! Awwwwwwww!
* Approach your pet to interact and watch it's reaction! Cuuuttteee!!!
* Pets names and locations are saved when you save, so they'll always be there to welcome you back at base! 

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
* Pets can become "stuck" in furniture and nooks and crannies in your base. A swift whack might get them moving in the right direction.
* Pointing straight down when spawning can eject the little buggers out the floor of your base. Point at a position a little ways ahead before spawning to avoid this.
* If a pet falls into the moonpool, it will be so shocked it won't even realise it's in water. The only way out is to put the poor creature out of its misery.
